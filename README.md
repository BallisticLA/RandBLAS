### RandBLAS : A C++ library for sketching in randomized linear algebra

RandBLAS supports high-level randomized linear algebra algorithms (like randomized low-rank SVD) that might be implemented in other libraries.

Our goal is for RandBLAS to become a standard like the BLAS, in that hardware vendors might
release their own optimized implementations of algorithms which confirm to the RandBLAS API.

### Source Code

The source code can be obtained at the [RandBLAS github repository](https://github.com/BallisticLA/RandBLAS).

### Documentation

See [RandBLAS User's Guide](https://randblas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a terse but thorough overview of RandBLAS' functionality.
