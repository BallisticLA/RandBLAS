### RandBLAS

RandBLAS - A C++ library for sketching in randomized linear algebra.  RandBLAS
provides a standard library that supports randomized linear algebra algorithms
in other libraries.  RandBLAS will eventually become a standard like the BLAS,
in that hardware vendors might release their own optimized implementations of
algorithms which confirm to the RandBLAS API.

### Source Code

The source code can be obtained at the [RandBLAS github repository](https://github.com/BallisticLA/RandBLAS).

### Documentation

The [RandBLAS User's Guide](https://randblas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) documents
compiling and use of HAMR and contains simple examples.

The [RandBLAS Doxygen site](https://randblas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doxygen/index.html) documents the APIs.
