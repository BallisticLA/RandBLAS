This is a repo to host BALLISTIC-internal RBLAS prototyping.
Some implementations here are embarrasingly bad.
Some code in this repo is only about tooling (e.g., pybind11 tutorials) to help in future development.

### How to work in this repo

If you work in this repo, create a folder with your name.
You have total authority over what goes in that folder.
If you have something presentable that you want to reference later, then a copy should be kept in the "sharing" folder.

When you make an entry in the sharing folder you should has the format "year-mm-dd-[your initials]-[letter]".
 * You substitute-in "[your initials]" with whatever short character string is appropriate for you (for Riley John Murray, that's rjm).
The "[letter]" should start every day with "a" and then increment along the alphabet.
 * Hopefully you won't have more than 26 folders you'd want to add to "sharing" on one day.

If you need source code for a third-party library in order to run your experiments, put the source code in the "extern" folder.
