# RandBLAS examples

Files in this directory show how RandBLAS can be used to implement high-level RandNLA algorithms.
Right now we have two such examples.
 1. A sketch-and-solve approach to the total least squares problem.
 2. Basic methods for finding factored representations of low-rank sparse matrices.
